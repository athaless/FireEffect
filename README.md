# FireEffect

Fire effects in assembly (asm.x86)

<table width:100%>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./_/FireEffect_Image1.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="./_/FireEffect_Image2.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="./_/FireEffect_Image3.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The ".exe" file still should be run well on a DOSBox (in fact that was the way I got these screenshots above). Maybe it's possible to mount .asm for 64 bits if you want ;-).
